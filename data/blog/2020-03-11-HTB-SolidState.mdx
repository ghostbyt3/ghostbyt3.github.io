We are going to pwn SolidState from Hack The Box.

Lets Begin with our Initial Nmap Scan.

## Nmap Scan Results:
```

## HTTP:

The Webpage looks useless, Nothing Special.[br/](br/)

## MAIL:

Nmap Scan reveales James which is an mail server.

>Apache James, a.k.a. Java Apache Mail Enterprise Server or some variation thereof, is an open source SMTP and POP3 mail transfer agent and NNTP news server written entirely in Java. 

I searched for any exploits available in Searchsploit.[br/](br/)
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-solidstate/3.png)

>https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/35513

The Exploit revealed Default credentials of Port 4555

```
# credentials to James Remote Administration Tool (Default - root/root)
user = 'root'
pwd = 'root'
```

So I logged in with these credentials[br/](br/)

HELP command reveals we can see the list of users and we can even change the mail password. I changed ``mindy`` mail password.
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-solidstate/5.png)

So Password is reset for user ``mindy``.

We Changed User's mail password and POP3 is Open, So we can view the mails received by user ``mindy`` using ``telnet``
>Post Office Protocol is an application-layer Internet standard protocol used by e-mail clients to retrieve e-mail from a mail server. POP version 3 is the version in common use.

This Article helps me to use POP3 in command line.

First Message doesn't have anything useful but Second messange give me SSH password for ``mindy``.
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-solidstate/7.png)

## SSH:

``mindy : P@55W0rd1!2@``[br/](br/)
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-solidstate/8.png)

Got User Flag!!.

We can see that we have rbash which is Restricted Bash so we are restricted to use some commands. So I googled about how to escape rbash and found [this](https://speakerdeck.com/knaps/escape-from-shellcatraz-breaking-out-of-restricted-unix-shells?slide=9). We can also use ``bash –noprofile`` in ssh.

``
--noprofile
              Do  not  read either the system-wide startup file /etc/profile or any of the personal initialization files ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_lo‐
              gin, or ~/.profile.  By default, bash reads these files when it is invoked as a login shell.
``

## Another Method:

We already found an [exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/35513) which runs the payload if someone logs in.

I changed the payload to give us reverse shell.[br/](br/)
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-solidstate/10.png)

Run the exploit and started my nc listener on another terminal and Logged in SSH.
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-solidstate/11.png)

Now we have normal bash shell.

## Privilege Escalation:

My Enumeration Script revealed there is a file with writeable permission in ``/opt/tmp.py`` which is running as root. Maybe its a cronjob.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-solidstate/12.png)

I changed the script and gave SETUID to ``/bin/sh`` 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-solidstate/13.png)

SETUID make the executable ``/bin/sh`` to run as root because the script is running as root.

So When I use run ``sh`` I will get root shell

I'm Root!!

## Extra:

Instead of using ``telnet`` command line for ``pop3``, We can use Thunderbird Mail Client.

All we need to do is, Open ThunderBird -> Add Email -> Login
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-solidstate/55.png)

Now we can view the mail in better GUI
