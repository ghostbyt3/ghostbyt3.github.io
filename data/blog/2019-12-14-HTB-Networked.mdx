We are going to pwn Networked from Hack The Box.

Like always begin with our Nmap Scan.

## HTTP Enumeration

Lets Begin with HTTP

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-networked/2.png)

Looks like a normal webpage , run our Gobuster to get any useful directories.

```bash

```

While Checking ``/backup`` found ``backup.tar``<br/>
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-networked/3.png)

So I dowloaded it to my machine , to see whats inside.<br/>
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-networked/4.png)<br/>
It has some ``php`` file maybe webpages of the machine

While seeing the code ``upload.php`` as some filter process. It accepts only jpg,png,gif,jpeg.<br/>
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-networked/5.png)

### File Upload Vulnerability

``Upload.php``<br/>
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-networked/6.png)

``photos.php``<br/>
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-networked/7.png)
Looks like we can view uploaded files in ``photos.php``.

So I created my payload <br/>
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-networked/8.png)<br/>
By adding ``GIF89`` on the first it makes the payload as ``.gif`` <br/>
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-networked/9.png)

I uploaded my payload in ``upload.php``<br/>
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-networked/10.png)

Started my listener and reloaded ``photos.php``<br/>
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-networked/11.png)<br/>
I got the shell!!

## Getting User Shell


While Checking Home directory there is a file called ``check_attack.php``<br/>
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-networked/12.png)

While reading it I came to know it executes ``nohup``

>  nohup - run a command immune to hangups, with output to a non-tty

And ``nohup`` do force ``rm`` all files($value) in the folder ($path).

```
rm - remove files or directories
-f - force
```

The path is defined as ``var/www/html/uploads``.
So we need to hijack it.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-networked/13.png)

I created a file that hold payload in its name. By using semicolon in the beginning it makes the ``nohup`` to end after it ``rm`` and then exec ``nc``.

Started my listener

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-networked/14.png)

I got the user shell!!

## Privilege Escalation

As always I started with ``sudo -l``

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-networked/15.png)

We can run ``changename.sh`` as root without password.
So I tested to see how it works.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-networked/16.png)<br/>
It Looks like some network-scripts 

While searching I got this 

>https://vulmon.com/exploitdetails?qidtp=maillist_fulldisclosure&qid=e026a0c5f83df4fd532442e1324ffa4f

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-networked/17.png)

By doing so I injected ``/bin/bash`` with ``NAME``
And I got the Root Shell
