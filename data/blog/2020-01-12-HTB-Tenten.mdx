We are going to pwn Tenten from Hack The Box.

Like always begin with our Nmap Scan.

## HTTP

Since its a wordpress site we can enumerate using ``wpscan`` to get see if there is any users and plugins available<br/>
Found a Plugin called ``job-manager``
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-tenten/3.png)

Found an User  ``takis``<br/>
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-tenten/4.png)

I started searching for any exploits available for that plugin and found

>https://vagmour.eu/cve-2015-6668-cv-filename-disclosure-on-job-manager-wordpress-plugin/

From the blog I found there is a directory ``/index.php/jobs/apply/@@/``<br/>
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-tenten/5.png)

As we can see there is an ID and when I changed to some random numbers and job title has been changed.<br/>
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-tenten/6.png)

So I started trying some random number to check if there is anything useful for us.<br/>
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-tenten/7.png)<br/>
Found this ``HackerAccessGranted`` from the ID 13 , Which looks suspecious.

In WordPress there is directory structure for the uploaded files is recognized by ``/wp-content/uploads/%year%/%month%/%filename%``
 
There is a python script given in the above Link ``CVE-2015-6668`` which helps to find the exact directory of the file location by bruteforcing.

I did some modifications on the script 

> - Changed the year range to the year of the box released.
> - Changed the extensions.

```

It found the exact location of the file ``HackerAccessGranted``

Opened the link and its an image.<br/>
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-tenten/9.png)

This is the image we found!!<br/>
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-tenten/10.1.jpg)

Downloaded it to my machine to check with ``steghide`` to see if there is anything hidden.

> steghide - a steganography program

Got SSH Private key so lets use ssh2john before cracking it with john<br/>
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-tenten/11.png)<br/>
I saved the output as ``ssh2john`` and I gave it to ``john`` to crack the password.<br/>
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-tenten/12.png)<br/>

So the password is ``superpassword``. We already know there is an user named ``takis``<br/>

## Privilege Escalation:

Like always I started with ``sudo -l``<br/>
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-tenten/14.png)

Looks like we can run ``fuckin`` as root without password.<br/>
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-tenten/15.png)<br/>
``fuckin`` seems to be a script that contains arguments and that we need to pass on.

Lets try with ``whoami``

Now its time to get reverse shell as root using the ``fuckin``<br/>
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-tenten/16.png)

Started my listener<br/>
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-tenten/17.png)

I got Root!
