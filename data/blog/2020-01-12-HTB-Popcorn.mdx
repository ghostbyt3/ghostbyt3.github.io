``/torrent`` Looks Interesting
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-popcorn/3.png)

I searched for any exploits available and got this one[br/](br/)
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-popcorn/4.png)

> https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/11746

So it is an file upload vulnerability

So First we need to create an account [br/](br/)
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-popcorn/5.png)

Account Successfully created and I started searching for any uploads available.[br/](br/)
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-popcorn/6.png)

And found this , So I uploaded random ``.torrent`` file to see what we can do with it.[br/](br/)
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-popcorn/7.png)

Once uploaded it shows me this page with an option for ``Edit this Torrent`` which is interesting.[br/](br/)
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-popcorn/8.png)

There is an option to upload a picture as Screenshot. So we can try creating a image with reverse shell inside it.[br/](br/)
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-popcorn/9.png)

I created a Payload with ``GIF89`` which makes the file to look like gif image and saved it as ``shell.php.gif``[br/](br/)
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-popcorn/10.png)

While uploading I captured the intercept via burp and removed that ``.gif`` and Forwarded.[br/](br/)
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-popcorn/11.png)

File Uploaded[br/](br/)
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-popcorn/12.png)

Once uploaded I tried to view the image inorder to start our payload, by clicking on the image it opened. [br/](br/)
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-popcorn/13.png)

Started my nc listener[br/](br/)
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-popcorn/14.png)

## Privilege Escalation

Its is an old kernel version.[br/](br/)
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-popcorn/15.png)

Searched for the exploit available for this version and got ``Dirty Cow`` exploit.[br/](br/)
> https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/40839

Uploaded it to the box and Followed the instruction.[br/](br/)
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-popcorn/16.png)

New Account created as ``root``[br/](br/)
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-popcorn/17.png)

Got Root Flag.
