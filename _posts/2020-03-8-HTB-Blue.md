We are going to pwn Blue from Hack The Box.

Lets Begin with our Initial Nmap Scan.

## Nmap Scan Results:
```

```

The name of the box is hint, it may be ``eternalblue`` exploit.

We can check that by running nmap script.
>nmap -A -p445 --script vuln 10.10.10.40

```
Host script results:
|_smb-vuln-ms10-054: false
|_smb-vuln-ms10-061: NT_STATUS_OBJECT_NAME_NOT_FOUND
| smb-vuln-ms17-010:

|     State: VULNERABLE

|     Risk factor: HIGH
|       A critical remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft SMBv1

```
So my guess is correct.

What Is EternalBlue?

EternalBlue is an exploit most likely developed by the NSA as a former zero-day. It was released in 2017 by the Shadow Brokers, a hacker group known for leaking tools and exploits used by the Equation Group, which has possible ties to the Tailored Access Operations unit of the NSA.

EternalBlue, also known as MS17-010, is a vulnerability in Microsoft's Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. SMB allows systems to share access to files, printers, and other resources on the network. The vulnerability is allowed to occur because earlier versions of SMB contain a flaw that lets an attacker establish a null session connection via anonymous login. An attacker can then send malformed packets and ultimately execute arbitrary commands on the target.
