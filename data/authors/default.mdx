Hi, I’m Nikhil John Thomas, a Penetration Tester with certifications including OSCE3 (OSWE, OSED, OSEP), OSCP, and others. I enjoy honing my skills by hacking machines on platforms like HackTheBox, VulnHub, and TryHackMe.

In this blog, I share detailed writeups of the boxes I’ve hacked, providing insights into my methodologies and techniques. My goal is to help others learn and grow in the exciting field of cybersecurity.
