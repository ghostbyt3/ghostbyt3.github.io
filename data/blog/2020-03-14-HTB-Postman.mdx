We are going to pwn Postman by TheCyberGeek from Hack The Box. I enjoyed the way to get user shell.

Lets Begin with our Initial Nmap Scan.

Nmap Scan Results:

The Only thing I got from webpage is email address at the bottom.

And Gobuster results doesn't reveal any useful directories.

So I started checking other ports.

Found that port ``6379`` - ``redis`` looks suspecious. I started searching for any vulnerabilities.
Found this!

>Redis, is an open source, widely popular data structure tool that can be used as an in-memory distributed database, message broker or cache. Since it is designed to be accessed inside trusted environments, it should not be exposed on the Internet. However, some Redisâ€™ are bind to public interface and even has no password authentication protection.

So from the above statement we need to check whether redis has no password authentication. We can do that with ``telnet``

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-postman/3.png)<br/>
Yeah! It works it doesn't ask for any authentication. Now I can continue with the article.

So First we need to create a ``ssh`` keys so I can enter the machine.
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-postman/4.png)<br/>
And I generated a pair of keys.<br/>
We know that ``.pub`` must be inside the box so only we can connect it with our private key. And I changed that ``keys.pub`` to ``foo.txt`` with two blank lines before and after the public key.

We can use ``redis-cli`` to get command line interface. We can install it with ``apt install redis-tools``.

> redis-cli - Command-line client to redis-server

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-postman/5.png)

```
-h Redis-Server which we need to connect 

-x is saying that we are setting the key in redis named s-key with our pub key (foo.txt).
```

Yeah We send our pub key(foo.txt) successfully. Now its time to configure.
We can connect the server using same ``redis-cli -h IP``.

Now What we want to do here is to store ``s-key`` (SSH public key) in the ``.ssh`` folder so that we can remote SSH login to the target machine.
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-postman/6.png)

So I created ``.ssh`` inside ``/var/lib/redis`` which we have permission.
And Changed the name to ``authorized_keys`` and ``save``.

Now Our key is in ``/redis/.ssh`` so we can login as ``redis`` now with our private key.

And we can now log in to the box with SSH
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-postman/7.png)

So I searched for any interesting files in the box and got ``id_rsa.bak``
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-postman/8.png)

We can crack the RSA Private Key using ``john``
For that we need to use ``ssh2john`` first.
If you don't have , you can get it from [here](https://github.com/koboi137/john/blob/bionic/ssh2john.py).
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-postman/9.png)

I copied the result and saved it as ``pass`` .Now we can use this to crack with ``john``

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-postman/10.png)

We got the password ``computer2008`` I saw the user from home dir. I tried SSH login with the password but I can't. Using ``su`` from the redis shell I can log in as ``Matt``.

``matt : computer2008``<br/>

## Privilege Escalation:

We know port ``10000`` running ``Webmin 1.910``, which is an old version.
There is an exploit, 
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-postman/12.png)

> https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46984

I fired up my metasploit and searched for the exploit and 
Its asking for the ``USER`` and ``PASSWORD`` so I used the Matt user.
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-postman/13.png)

It worked <br/>
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-postman/14.png)

I got Root!!
