We are going to pwn Haystack from Hack The Box.

Link : <https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/machines/profile/195>


Like always begin with our Nmap Scan.

## Nmap Scan Results:

```
PORT     STATE SERVICE
22/tcp   open  ssh
80/tcp   open  http
9200/tcp open  wap-wsp

Lets begin our enumeration from HTTP<br/>

Only one image it look suspecious, So I downloaded it to my machine.

I used ``strings`` on the image.

>strings - print the sequences of printable characters in files

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-haystack/3.png)<br/>

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-haystack/5.png)<br/>
It gives me some base64 code so I decoded it.

It looks like spanish so we translate and see.<br/>
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-haystack/6.png)

It gives us some hint or message. `` the needle in the haystack is 'key' ``

While checking ``9200`` port I came to know It is a ``elasticsearch``<br/>
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-haystack/7.png)<br/>
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-haystack/8.png)

It is a searchengine so we can search for ``clave`` because it is the ``key``(Guess)
I dont know how to search so I googled.
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-haystack/9.png)

I did the same and I got 2 spanish words again so I decoded it <br/>

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-haystack/12.png)

Got ``user`` and ``password``and I logged in with ``ssh`` as ``security : spanish.is.key``<br/>

## Privilege Escalation:

I uploaded ``pspy`` to check is there any cronjob
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-haystack/14.png)
I noticed that ``logstash`` was running as root.

> Logstash is an open source tool for collecting, parsing, and storing logs for future use. Kibana 3 is a web interface that can be used to search and view the logs that Logstash has indexed. Both of these tools are based on Elasticsearch. 


So I went to the location and see whats in there.
```
[security@haystack tmp]$ cd /etc/logstash/conf.d/
[security@haystack conf.d]$ ls -al
total 12
drwxrwxr-x. 2 root kibana  62 Jun 24 08:12 .
drwxr-xr-x. 3 root root   183 Jun 18 22:15 ..
-rw-r-----. 1 root kibana 131 Jun 20 10:59 filter.conf
-rw-r-----. 1 root kibana 186 Jun 24 08:12 input.conf
-rw-r-----. 1 root kibana 109 Jun 24 08:12 output.conf
[security@haystack conf.d]$ cat input.conf 
cat: input.conf: Permission denied
[security@haystack conf.d]$ cat filter.conf 
cat: filter.conf: Permission denied
[security@haystack conf.d]$ cat output.conf 
cat: output.conf: Permission denied
[security@haystack conf.d]$ 
```
I dont have read and write permissions on the files.The user ``kibana`` can read them, so we need to be ``kibana``

My Linux Enumeration script shows a port listening on the localhost.
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-haystack/15.png)

So I curl that to see what it is 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-haystack/16.png)<br/>
It is confirmed as ``kibana``

> Kibana is an open source data visualization dashboard for Elasticsearch. It provides visualization capabilities on top of the content indexed on an Elasticsearch cluster. 

Lets check its version first, I googled that<br/>
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-haystack/17.png)

I tried them in the machine<br/>
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-haystack/18.png)

Its ``6.4.2``, We can do port forwarding to see whats running on the box.
We need to ``` ~C ``` will open ssh interactive shell and then ``` -L 5602:127.0.0.1:5601 ``` Which port forward 5601 to 5602.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-haystack/19.png)

Now we can see them on our browser from the port ``5602``<br/>
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-haystack/20.png)

We already know the version of it , so I searched for any exploits available and found this one from github.

>https://github.com/mpgn/CVE-2018-17246

I uploaded them into the machine.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-haystack/21.png)

I got the shell as ``kibana``
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-haystack/22.png)

Now we can check what's in ``logstash``

There are 3 conf files<br/>
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-haystack/23.png)

Input check in the path ``/opt/kibana`` for the file ``logstash_*``

Next it filter some commands if its not matching the ``message``

Then it executes.

So all we need to do is create a file with name ``logstash_anything`` and create a command which match the ``message`` and put in the folder ``/opt/kibana`` 
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-haystack/24.png)

I got Root!!
