Hi, I’m Nikhil John Thomas! I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast passionate about exploring web exploitation, red teaming, and reverse engineering. I enjoy honing my skills by hacking machines on platforms like HackTheBox and engaging in self-learning.

In this blog, I share detailed write-ups of the boxes I’ve hacked, offering insights into my methodologies and techniques, or simply documenting what I’ve learned. My goal is to share my experiences, insights, and discoveries.
