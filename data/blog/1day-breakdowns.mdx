Welcome to the **1-Day Breakdown** series ‚Äî a curated collection of publicly disclosed CVEs, distilled into short and digestible posts that take less than **5‚Äì10 minutes** to read.

Each post offers:
- A clear breakdown of the vulnerability
- Key technical insights
- Proof-of-Concept (PoC) code (where available)
- Focus on ease of understanding for researchers, pentesters, and reverse engineers.
